# Lab 2  
**Convert your personal page into a Ruby on Rails app**

In this lab, you will transform the personal page you created in **Lab 1** into a web application using **Ruby on Rails**. You must use **PostgreSQL** as the database and apply **Bootstrap** for styling. The goal is to display the same content from Lab 1 in an "About" page within the Rails application.


##  Instructions

1. Create a new Rails app with PostgreSQL

2. Add Bootstrap

3. Create the `About` controller and route

4. Populate the About page with your Lab 1 content

In the view, use the content you created in Lab 1 as a starting point but yo can make changes to it. Your page should include:

- Full name  
- Degree and year of admission  
- GitHub link  
- Short personal summary  
- Table of your skills (programming languages, tools, etc.)

Use **Bootstrap classes** to style your content (e.g., containers, headers, tables, etc.).
